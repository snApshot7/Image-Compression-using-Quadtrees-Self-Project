# Image-Compression-using-Quadtrees-Self-Project
his program applies the quadtree data structure for image compression by recursively splitting the image into smaller quadrants based on criteria like depth or detail level. Each quadrant stores its detail and color information, allowing accurate reconstruction of the original image from the quadtree.
